# Unit 9 Recap

Hello students,

For a recap of last night's activities, reference the [Unit 9 Agenda](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/units/unit-9/agenda.md), and view the [Unit 9 Video](http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/30aada1b10644ae98531c737551c1b481d).

We dedicated all of class time to [Freestyle Project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/projects/freestyle/project.md) implementation, including planning, investigation, development, and testing.

On Wednesday night, there will be at least 90 minutes of additional time to work on projects. I hope to also use some of the time to demonstrate to at least a few of you how to deploy software to a server to make it publicly accessible

\- Professor Rossetti
