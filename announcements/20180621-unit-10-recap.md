# Unit 10 Recap

Hello students,

For a recap of last night's activities, reference the [Unit 10 Agenda](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/units/unit-10/agenda.md), and view the [Unit 10 Video](http://nyustern.mediasite.com/Mediasite/Play/4e334b55fddb4f048d91a208f56854a41d).

We dedicated most of class time to [Freestyle Project](https://github.com/prof-rossetti/nyu-info-2335-201805/blob/master/projects/freestyle/project.md) development and testing.

Your apps are looking awesome! I'm so inspired by your creativity and excited to see the final results. Please expect to finish Freestyle Project by around Monday at 5pm. If you changed your repository name or URL from your original Proposal submission, you will need to submit a PR noting your revised repository URL, otherwise, no need to re-submit. If you need any help or have any questions as you finish your projects, send me a DM on Slack.

Also, sometime between Thursday at 9am and Monday at 9am, please submit your sixth and final [Weekly Check-in Form](https://goo.gl/forms/6MiFYOcwBdDulp763). :tada:

On Monday night we will participate in a "retrospective" exercise and prepare for the Final Exam. Have a great weekend, and see you then!
